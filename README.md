## Performances and Optimizations

 ## ⚡ Performance Comparisons (Before vs. After)

| Initial Build (Unoptimized) | Optimized Production (Vite + React 18) |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![Before ](/public/assets/images/before.png) | ![After ](/public/assets/images/mobile_after.png) |
| *Lighthouse Score: 78* | *Lighthouse Score: 99* |



## Before Performance
Status: Initial Development Build
The application was functional but suffered from high layout shift and delayed interactivity. Initial bundle sizes were unoptimized, leading to slower load times on 3G/4G mobile networks and a lower SEO ranking.

## After Performance
Status: Optimized Production Build
Engineered for speed using Vite and React 18. I implemented strategic code-splitting and asset compression, resulting in an instantaneous "app-like" feel. The UI is now fluid, with zero jank during transitions.

## Before Metrics
Lighthouse Score: 78

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 1.9s (Needs Improvement)

Total Blocking Time (TBT): 820ms

Issues: Unused JavaScript, unoptimized heavy images, and render-blocking resources.

## After Optimization Metrics
Lighthouse Score: 99

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 0.8s (Fast)

Total Blocking Time (TBT): 0ms (Perfect)

Optimization Steps: Implemented Lazy Loading, WebP image conversion, and minification of CSS/JS. This ensures the best possible Google Search ranking.

## Testing Show (Reliability)
Methodology: Unit & Integration Testing
To ensure performance gains don't break over time, I implemented a robust testing suite using Vitest. This validates that components render correctly, hooks maintain state, and the Contact Form integrates perfectly with EmailJS.
